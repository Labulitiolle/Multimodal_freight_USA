    """Returns a list of nodes in a shortest path between source and target
    using the A* ("A-star") algorithm.
    There may be more than one shortest path.  This returns only one.
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
    source : node
       Starting node for path
    target : node
       Ending node for path
    heuristic : function
       A function to evaluate the estimate of the distance
       from the a node to the target.  The function takes
       two nodes arguments and must return a number.
    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.
       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.
